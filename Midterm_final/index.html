Social Media Quiz
Claudia Goyette

multi-page website that is a quiz telling you Â« What kind of social media user are you? .
I wanted to make a critic on social medias and how we use them but not necessarily for the right reasons.
The quiz itself is very easy to take and straightforward but the results are what is the most important to look at.
